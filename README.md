# NextWordPredictionUsingLSTM-RNN-
Prediction of next possible word in a sentence using Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM)

I have used the Recurrent Neural Network for this purpose. This model was chosen because it provides a way to examine the previous input. LSTM, a special kind of RNN is also used for this purpose
